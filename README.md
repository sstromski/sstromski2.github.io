When crafting my resume, I wanted to both make it look professional and organized, but also have some artistic value to it that would make it stand out from other resumes. I figured that blue would be a good color to use, as it is easy on the eyes and has a professional look to it. I used a soft blue for the background, with a navy for the title to make it stand out, and made the text white, as it made the whole document look calming.
As I was coding, I initially had difficulty trying to organize all my information. I kept forgetting to add semicolons to the end of my commands, which was a rookie mistake. I have always struggled with certain aspects of coding, so this exercise really helped me understand more about html and css, and will hopefully give me ammunition to do better in the future.
